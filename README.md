trying out pygame by making a game

i suck

## Run Instructions:
Install pygame or pygame-ce with `pip3 install [pygame/pygame-ce]` (just pick whatever community edition is more worked on i think)

Run `py main.py chatgpt_generated_1` (Note that chatgpt_generated_1 is the name for .json file, just go ask chatgpt to generate a script for you its somewhat entertaining)

Code will read a json file as a 'script'. Too lazy to document.
